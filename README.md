## ✨ Immersive UX Features

### 🖥️ System Boot Sequence

### 🕵️ X-Ray Scanner Cursor

An advanced custom cursor system featuring:

### 🎬 Premium Motion Suite

Moving away from varied, jumpy animations to a unified yet diverse set of professional reveals:

- **Elevate**: Sophisticated slide-up with blur-to-focus transition.
- **Reveal**: Clean horizontal mask sweep.

- **SoftFocus**: Snap-to-focus gaussian blur entrance.
- **FluidGlide**: Frictionless horizontal displacement.

### ☣️ System Override (Easter Egg)

Trigger the "Protocol Breach" by entering the Konami Code:  
`↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A`

> [!WARNING]
> Activates CRT distortion, screen-shake protocols, and the ambient Matrix-theme digital rain.
